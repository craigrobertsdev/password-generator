## Motivation

This project was motivated by the need to have strong and secure passwords.

## Problem Solved

The application takes in a small amount of user data and produces a password that is strong enough to secure a user's data. 

## What I Learned
In this project I learnt how to use basic browser functionality to alert the user or capture input from them.  

I also learnt how JavaScript's random number generation worked and ways of organising data to avoid repetition while structuring an application.
